------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Now, let's organize our insights and analyze why these patterns emerged:

1. Top and Lowest-Selling Items:
		- Over the past three months, the best-selling item was the 'Hamburger', while the lowest-selling item was 'Chicken Tacos'.
		- Although 'Chicken Tacos' is among the cheaper items, it was sold only '123' times, which raises a concern.
          This may indicate an issue with its taste or that customers are less inclined toward certain 'Mexican' dishes.
		- However, itâ€™s worth noting that another 'Mexican' dish, the 'Steak Torta', sold '489' times. 
          This suggests the problem might be specific to the 'Chicken Tacos' recipe rather than 'Mexican' food overall.

2. Demand for Italian Cuisine:
		- When analyzing the highest-spending orders, 'Italian' food consistently ranked as the most popular choice, while 'Asian' food was the least popular.
		- Despite its higher prices, 'Italian' dishes seem to be favored by customers, particularly those who place larger or more expensive orders. 
          This behavior suggests that wealthier customers tend to prefer 'Italian' cuisine, likely perceiving it as more luxurious or aligning with their taste preferences.
		- Interestingly, these customers showed little interest in 'Asian' food, despite its generally lower price point.
          This indicates that affordability alone is not the main driver of their choices.
		- However, it's worth noting that the 'Cheese Lasagna', one of the more affordable 'Italian' dishes, was sold '207' times less than other 'Italian' options.
          This reinforces the idea that customers' preferences lean toward specific premium 'Italian' dishes rather than being price-sensitive.
          
3. Top Five Orders Breakdown:
		- Among the top five orders, 'Italian' food emerged as the most in-demand category,
          followed by 'Mexican' food, even though 'Mexican' dishes tend to be priced higher.
          
4. Popularity of Edamame:
		- The 'Edamame' was the second most-sold item over three months, with '620' orders.
          Its affordability, priced at just '$5', likely contributed significantly to its popularity.
          
5. Overall Cuisine Trends:
		- Over the three months, 'Asian' food was the most-sold category, with '3,470' orders, 
          while 'American' food was the least sold, with '2,734' orders.
		- This trend could be attributed to the lower average price of 'Asian' dishes compared to 'American' cuisine, 
          making them more accessible to a broader range of customers.
